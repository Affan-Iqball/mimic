## ❤️ The Story Behind Mimic
I built this game for one simple reason: **Family Game Night.**

I play *Undercover* with my siblings all the time, but we were frustrated. The existing apps were either:
1.  **Locked behind paywalls** (subscriptions just to get new words? No thanks).
2.  **Boring & Repetitive** (same generic "Apple/Orange" words).
3.  **Lacking Flavor** (completely missing the cultural context we joke about).

So I decided to build my own. **Mimic** is my personal take on the genre—completely free, ad-free, and injected with a **"Modern Desi Twist"**.

It mixes global pop culture (*Netflix/YouTube*) with the things we actually talk about (*Biryani/Pulao, Arranged Marriage/Love Marriage*). It's built to be the most fun way to determine who among us is the imposter.

## ✨ Features
*   **Bento Grid UI**: A sleek, dark-mode-first design inspired by modern aesthetics.
*   **Spicy Mode 🌶️**: Toggle for "Edgy/Mature" themes when playing with friends.
*   **Smart AI Engine**: Powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro to generate infinite, unique word pairs.
*   **Offline Ready**: Includes a hand-picked "Static Bank" of 100+ culturally relevant words.
*   **Group System**: Create squads with your friends' names and specific colors.
